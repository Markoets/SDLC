                <p class="card-text">Context Large-scale software projects require interaction between many stakeholders. Behavior-driven development (BDD) facilitates collaboration between stakeholders, and an adapted BDD process can help improve cooperation in a large-scale project. Objective The objective of this study is to propose and empirically evaluate a BDD based process adapted for large-scale projects. Method A technology transfer model was used to propose a BDD based process for large-scale projects. We conducted six workshop sessions to understand the challenges and benefits of BDD. Later, an industrial evaluation was performed for the process with the help of practitioners. Results From our investigations, understanding of a business aspect of requirements, their improved quality, a guide to system-level use-cases, reuse of artifacts, and help for test organization are found as benefits of BDD. Practitioners identified the following challenges: specification and ownership of behaviors, adoption of new tools, the software projects’ scale, and versioning of behaviors. We proposed a process to address these challenges and evaluated the process with the help of practitioners. Conclusion The evaluation proved that BDD could be adapted and used to facilitate interaction in large-scale software projects in the software industry. The feedback from the practitioners helped in improving the proposed process</p>

                <h4 class="card-title">Design-driven development</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Our environment is increasingly populated with large amounts of smart objects. Some monitor free parking spaces, others analyze material conditions in buildings or detect unsafe pollution levels in cities. The massive amounts of sensing and actuation devices constitute large-scale infrastructures that span over entire parking lots, campuses of buildings or agricultural fields. Despite being successfully deployed in a number of domains, the development of applications for such infrastructures remains challenging. Considerable knowledge about the hardware/network specificities of the sensor infrastructure is required on the part of the developer. To address this problem, software development methodologies and tools raising the level of abstraction need to be introduced to allow non-expert developers program applications.This dissertation presents a design-driven methodology for the development of applications orchestrating massive amounts of networked objects. The methodology is based on a domain-specific design language, named DiaSwarm that provides high-level, declarative constructs allowing developers to deal with masses of objects at design time, prior to programming the application. Generative programming is used to produce design-specific programming frameworks to guide and support the development of applications in this domain. The methodology integrates the parallel processing of large-amounts of data collected from masses of sensors. We introduce specific language declarations resulting in the generation of programming frameworks based on the MapReduce programming model. We furthermore investigate how design can be used to make explicit the resources required by applications as well as their usage. To match the application requirements to a target sensor infrastructure, we consider design declarations at different stages of the application lifecycle.The scalability of this approach is evaluated in an experiment, which shows how the generated programming frameworks relying on the MapReduce programming model are used for the efficient processing of large datasets of sensor readings. We examine the effectiveness of the proposed approach in dealing with key software engineering challenges in this domain by implementing application scenarios provided to us by industrial partners. We solicited professional programmers to evaluate the usability of our approach and present quantitative and qualitative data from the experiment.</p>

ATDD encompasses many of the same practices as specification by example (SBE) behavior-driven development (BDD), example-driven development (EDD),and support-driven development also called story test–driven development (SDD). All these processes aid developers and testers in understanding the customer's needs prior to implementation and allow customers to be able to converse in their own domain language         </div>

                <p class="card-text">In computer programming, data-driven programming is a programming paradigm in which the program statements describe the data to be matched and the processing required rather than defining a sequence of steps to be taken. Standard examples of data-driven languages are the text-processing languages sed and AWK, where the data is a sequence of lines in an input stream – these are thus also known as line-oriented languages – and pattern matching is primarily done via regular expressions or line numbers. </p>
