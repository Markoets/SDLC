        <p>
        Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer<br>
        through early and continuous delivery<br>
        of valuable software.<br>
        Agreed since they will come back if they are satisfied
       </p>
        
        <p>
        Welcome changing requirements, even late in <br>
        development. Agile processes harness change for <br>
        the customer's competitive advantage.<br>
        Agree since that's a advantage for using agile.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Deliver working software frequently, from a <br>
        couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a <br>
        preference to the shorter timescale.<br>
        Slightly agree only if the customer wants it
     </p>
        
        <p>
        Business people and developers must work <br>
        together daily throughout the project.<br>
        Agreed since without eachother they would both be at an disadvantage.
     </p>
        
        <p>
        Build projects around motivated individuals. <br>
        Give them the environment and support they need, <br>
        and trust them to get the job done.<br>
        Slightly disagree since some people may be unmotivated but still get the job done.
</p>
        
        <p>
        The most efficient and effective method of <br>
        conveying information to and within a development <br>
        team is face-to-face conversation.<br>
        Disagree since covid and we have facecams
</p>
        
        <p>
        Working software is the primary measure of progress.<br>
        Agree
   </p>
        
        <p>
        Agile processes promote sustainable development. <br>
        The sponsors, developers, and users should be able <br>
        to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.<br>
        Disagree since there may be factors in play that are not in their control
     </p>
        
        <p>
        Continuous attention to technical excellence <br>
        and good design enhances agility.<br>
        Agreed since you will see your development 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount <br>
        of work not done--is essential.<br>
        Agreed since it will save time and  money.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The best architectures, requirements, and designs <br>
        emerge from self-organizing teams.<br>
        Slightly Agree since when they are self-organizing there is a higher chance that they care about it
</p>
        
        <p>
        At regular intervals, the team reflects on how <br>
        to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts <br>
        its behavior accordingly.<br>
        Agreed since it's part of developing your skills
