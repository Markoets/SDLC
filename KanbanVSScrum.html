    <div class="row">
        <div class="column"><p>Kanban</p>   <p>	There are no pre-defined roles for a team. Although there may still be a Project Manager, the team is encouraged to collaborate and chip in when any one person becomes overwhelmed.</p>
        <p>Products and processes are delivered continuously on an as-needed basis (with due dates determined by the business as needed).</p>
        <p>	Allows for changes to be made to a project mid-stream, allowing for iterations and continuous improvement prior to the completion of a projec</p>
        <p>Measures production using “cycle time,” or the amount of time it takes to complete one full piece of a project from beginning to end.</p>
        <p> i think worse since there are no pre-defined roles but processes are delivered continuously which is a slight edge and also can make changes mid-sprint</p>

            <p>Scrum</p>
            <p>Each team member has a predefined role, where the Scrum master dictates timelines, Product owner defines goals and objectives and team members execute the work.</p> 
            <p>Deliverables are determined by sprints, or set periods of time in which a set of work must be completed and ready for review.</p>
            <p>Changes during the sprint are strongly discouraged.</p>
            <p>Measures production using velocity through sprints. Each sprint is laid out back-to-back and/or concurrently so that each additional sprint relies on the success of the one before it.</p>
            <p>I think Scrum's has  a little edge because everyone has predefined role and they will be knowing what they will do but changes are discouraged which i think is a disadvantage</p>
