    <h1>SDLC</h1>
    <p>Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process used by the software industry to design, develop and test
        high quality softwares. The SDLC aims to produce a high-quality software that meets or exceeds customer
        expectations, reaches completion within times and cost estimates.

            <h2>Steps</h2>

            <button class="accordion">Step 1 Planning and Requirement Analysis</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>“What are the current problems?”
                    Requirement analysis is the most important and fundamental stage in SDLC. It is performed by the
                    senior members of the team with inputs from the customer, the sales department, market surveys and
                    domain experts in the industry. This information is then used to plan the basic project approach and
                    to conduct product feasibility study in the economical, operational and technical areas.

                    Planning for the quality assurance requirements and identification of the risks associated with the
                    project is also done in the planning stage. The outcome of the technical feasibility study is to
                    define the various technical approaches that can be followed to implement the project successfully
                    with minimum risks.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">Step 2 Defining Requirements</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>“What do we want?”
                    Once the requirement analysis is done the next step is to clearly define and document the product
                    requirements and get them approved from the customer or the market analysts. This is done through an
                    SRS (Software Requirement Specification) document which consists of all the product requirements to
                    be designed and developed during the project life cycle.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">Step 3 Designing the Product Architecture</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>“How will we get what we want?”  
                    SRS is the reference for product architects to come out with the best architecture for the product to
                    be developed. Based on the requirements specified in SRS, usually more than one design approach for
                    the product architecture is proposed and documented in a DDS - Design Document Specification.

                    This DDS is reviewed by all the important stakeholders and based on various parameters as risk
                    assessment, product robustness, design modularity, budget and time constraints, the best design
                    approach is selected for the product.

                    A design approach clearly defines all the architectural modules of the product along with its
                    communication and data flow representation with the external and third party modules (if any). The
                    internal design of all the modules of the proposed architecture should be clearly defined with the
                    minutest of the details in DDS.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">Step 4 Building or Developing the Product</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p> “Let’s create what we want.”
                    In this stage of SDLC the actual development starts and the product is built. The programming code
                    is generated as per DDS during this stage. If the design is performed in a detailed and organized
                    manner, code generation can be accomplished without much hassle.

                    Developers must follow the coding guidelines defined by their organization and programming tools
                    like compilers, interpreters, debuggers, etc. are used to generate the code. Different high level
                    programming languages such as C, C++, Pascal, Java and PHP are used for coding. The programming
                    language is chosen with respect to the type of software being developed.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="accordion">Step 5 Testing the Product</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>“Did we get what we want?”

                    This stage is usually a subset of all the stages as in the modern SDLC models, the testing activities
                    are mostly involved in all the stages of SDLC. However, this stage refers to the testing only stage
                    of the product where product defects are reported, tracked, fixed and retested, until the product
                    reaches the quality standards defined in the SRS.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="accordion">Step 6 Deployment in the Market and Maintenance</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>“Let’s start using what we got.”
                    Once the product is tested and ready to be deployed it is released formally in the appropriate
                    market. Sometimes product deployment happens in stages as per the business strategy of that
                    organization. The product may first be released in a limited segment and tested in the real business
                    environment (UAT- User acceptance testing).

                    Then based on the feedback, the product may be released as it is or with suggested enhancements in
                    the targeting market segment. After the product is released in the market, its maintenance is done
                    for the existing customer base.</p>
